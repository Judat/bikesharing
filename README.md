# Bikesharing

The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate our understanding of presenting the data using visulization tool like Tableau. 

## Overview of Bikesharing Data

The data we used in this challenge was from August 2019 CITI BIKE for different places in New York City. We used the data to find answers to different questions using Tableau. 
the link to story is as as under :

We also changed the columns tyoe by using our knowldge of Python and Panadas.

## Bikeshare Analysis Results:

The following images are self explainatory and we will add pointers to elaborate the analysis

* We can infer that most of the bikes were checked out for a duration of 20 mins or less. There is some demand till 40 mins and hardly much after an hour.

* The data changes the focus to custumers and subsribers in addition to filetring the data as per gender.
* A beautufil example how visulaization can make things simpler. Just a glance and one can infer that male subscribers are leading the way when it comes to taking the highest number of rides. 

## Summary

We can conclude folloiwng points from our visual analysis:

* Younger people tend to ride for more time.

* Most of the bikes will be checked out for 20 minutes to 40 minutes.

* Male rider and male subscribers us ethe bikes far more than others.

* Usually, thursdays tend to be busier days than others.
